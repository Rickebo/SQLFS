# SQLFS

SQLFS is a simple library for mounting a directory on Windows to SQL database, storing files in a database table. The
library was written to support storing YML files generated by another program in a database, and to support extracting
certain properties from these files into indexed columns in the database table, therefore allowing for faster lookups.

## Usage

See [github.com/Rickebo/EssentialsSql](https://github.com/Rickebo/EssentialsSql) for an example of how the library may be used.
